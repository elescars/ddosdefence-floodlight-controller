\chapter{Initial Requirements}

\section{Introduction}
In this project we will create a SDN controller for defense against DDoS attacks. Through a REST API system, a web server can notify the begin of a DDoS attack: the controller will create an address change mechanism from D to D’ while filtering malicious clients.

Web Server will cooperate changing the listening address to a new one (called D') while opening another instance of the web server on the old address (called D). On this instance, however, the server will provide a forwarding mechanism to D' enough complex to not be executed by bots.
All used addresses are took from a list of addresses, which can be configurated through the controller REST APIs.

Filtering is made by counting the number of connections made by the client after the defence is enabled: if this count gets above a certain threshold, then the client is marked as a bot. However this behavior happens only if bots/clients don't use HTTP \textit{keep-alive} mode, which would be surreal and not praticable for performance reasons: to solve this, the forwarding HTTP server instance will cut the connection after sending the forwarding response.

\section{Implementation}
Any of the mentioned sources will be declared as part of \textbf{ddosdefence} package.

\subsection{Controller receive()}
In this project we will implement the controller code following the already provided pseudo code:

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/PseudoCode.png}
\label{fig:pseudocode}
\caption{Controller pseudo code}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\textit{flowCount} will be implemented using an HashMap where the key is the client source IP and the value a list of ports: however, to give an efficient implementation, we will use an Hash, this time an HashSet, also to implement each list of ports. This is due to the fact that searching is an operation often needed for both the lists.

The source name will be \textbf{DDoSDefence.java}.

\subsection{REST APIs}
\textbf{COMPLETARE}\\
The source names will be \textbf{EnableDefenceResource.java, IDDoSDefenceREST.java}.

\subsection{LearningSwitch module changes}
LearningSwitch provides an implementation of L2 switch autolearning and gives a thread-safe service interface to access the switching table. LearningSwitch provides a public method to get the port associated to a destination MAC Address, however this is not provided by the \textbf{ILearningSwitch} interface.
We added the method to the interface, also assuming that we can execute it without any concurrency issue: this has been checked inspecting the internal method implementation.

\section{Assumptions}
Before starting the project we have thought about the issues we would have met, so we made the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First part of the paper, which establishes the change of server address from D to D ', will not be implemented.
	\item Number of IP addresses: predefined and sufficient for the purpose of the project. Our project involves the management of the number of IP addresses via a circular list for assignment. 
	\item Our project plans to define a reCAPTCHA service: we will insert an equivalent implemented by us. *
	\item ARP Handling 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Change the IP address but not the ARP table, the server will auto-assign the new IP address.
			\item This behavior is implemented in the forwarding module that must be included.
		\end{itemize}
	\item DELETE management: delete the precise rule dictated by the code. If you want to delete more than one, we must manage it keeping track of previous entries or inserting a maximum priority rule that invalidates the others.
\end{itemize}
* Assumptions are optional and will be implemented according to the difficulties we will encounter in the project.

\section{Testing System}
Our module will be tested using a set of scripts that we will produce, that emulates the client and server. Mininet will be used to create a virtual network composed  by a server and multiple (N) clients.

Server (h1) can use addresses from a /24 subnet, in our case 7.7.7.0/24 will be used.
Each client (h2-hN) will use an addresses took from the 80.80.80.0/24 subnet.
The Controller will listen for OpenFlow PACKET\_IN connections on 127.0.0.1:6653.
One OpenFlow switch (s1) will be used to connect all the previous entities. No routing or complex forwarding rules are required because the switch will solve the problem only using L2 Table packet switching. The only rule to use on both server and clients is \\
%\begin{lstlisting} %%%mi da errore sempre!!! uffffffff
“route add -net 0.0.0.0/32 dev <out interface>”
%\end{lstlisting}
\\
to send all the packet originated from the emulated device through the interface connected to the switch. ARP on the originating packet device will make sure to set the correct destination MAC address.
Clients can be regular service users or malicious ones:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bots: will continuously do HTTP requests to a single target, but will not be able to compute any complex forwarding (like CAPTCHA or JavaScript execution),
	\item Clients: will perform regular HTTP requests and be able to do forwarding.
\end{itemize}	
Both behaviours will be simulated using two separate scripts. Pseudo-code examples could be:
\paragraph{./start\_bot.sh serverip}
Start one connection at time and retry to connect if disconnected, with no end. Bots behavior can be different than this, for example another one bot could start more connection asynchronusly.  However this would just increase the connection count of system and could be implemented just using more synchronous bots.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={./start\_bot.sh pseudo code},captionpos=b]
while(true) {
	Establish HTTP on server connection using keepalive;
	continue when connection is closed
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{./start\_client.sh serverip}\
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={./start\_client.sh pseudo code},captionpos=b]
while(true) {
	Establish HTTP on server connection using keepalive;
	continue when connection is closed
	serverip = (if forwarded)  ? newaddress : serverip ; # user can process forward
	print forwarded address if forwarded
	sleep 2; # user will generate less traffic than bots
}

\end{lstlisting}

As stated on the paper, the forwarding method must be sufficiently complex to not be executed by the bots. However this represents an issue for ./start\_client.sh script that is, in reality, a bot itself. To overcome this issue, we can initially simplify the forwarding mechanism to let the script do the forward. However the ./start\_bot.sh will ignore, in good faith, the simplified forwarding directive.

An example of HTTP Page forwarding response could be one not containing an HTML page (we can check if contains \textless html\textgreater\ or not) but containing the address to forward. This is just for a testing purpose and can be subjected to changes as a consequence of chosen web server implementation.

\subsubsection{Checking the correct behaviour for OpenFlow rules:}
This command can be used to dump flow entries of all switches.
\begin{lstlisting}
mininet> dpctl dump-flows
\end{lstlisting}

This will be used to check if controller behavior meets the requirements. The following test can be done:

\paragraph{BOT/Client Connections arriving when protection is OFF}
Every connection/packet must be forwarded to the server and every (response) packet generated from server must be forwarded to client. This means we expect a list of entries like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
<<ARP Entries>>
src=<client ip>:<port>, dst_ip=<D>:<listen port>, ACTION: FORWARD
src=<srv_ip>:<listen port>, dst_ip=<cl_ip>:<cl_port>, ACTION: FORWARD
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{BOT Connections arriving when protection is ON}
We expect the same result as before, until client connections becomes more than threshold. At this point we expect (assuming only 1 connection made by client after threshold):
\begin{lstlisting}
<<ARP Entries>>
<<Old FORWARD Entries for connections started before reaching thresh.>>
src=<client ip>:<port>, dst_ip=<D>:<listen port>, ACTION: DROP
\end{lstlisting}
Old forward entries will be cleared by a rule timeout. Note that the web server, when forwarding, closes the connection after responding to the request, so, after the server response, all the Forward rules are not matched anymore.

\paragraph{Client Connections arriving when protection is ON}
If the client connects to D' address, all the old forward/drop rules related to that client must be deleted. So, after a client connects to D', we expect:
\begin{lstlisting}
<<ARP Entries>>
src=<client ip>:<port>, dst_ip=<D'>:<listen port>, ACTION: FORWARD
\end{lstlisting}
No old rules must be found.
